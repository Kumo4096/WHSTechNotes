there are many types of sensors on the sphero bots, like the acelerometor, pitch, and the light sensors
the one that i want to focus on in the light sensor. 
on the bot there is two diffeent light sensors. 
both on them on opisite sides of the bot.
these sensors respond to light in a way that give the bot instructions, so if one sensor has a light on it and will do a cerian set on instructions, and the reverse is also true about the other sensor. 
the sensors can have seprate stes of intructions so you can have some sort of a game to play with the two sensors.

The 4 c's are confident, couragous, consistant, and comunicate
The most inporatnt one i think for the topic of computer science is consistancy. This c means that evertyhing will be basicly the same. and being constitant in the way that you code is deffinently inporatn beacause coding is a very specific endevor so you have to be consistant int he way that you do things. If you even get line thing wrong your code will fail becasue of one little inconsistancy. So being consistant in your coding is probobly the most inportant thing you can do.

I find that the sphero is the easier of the two because its the first step into learning code
they showed me coding doesnt have to be hard it can be as easy ad dragging in a couple blocks to make a little ball move
pythin definilty gave you more controlbecasue it let you do specific things the sphero bolts didnt give you accsess too
Because python coding is verry specific in the way that it works so you have to have the knowlage and since you have the power to do things specificly you can also do more things

i reserched a softwear enginieer
 some fo the responcibilitys ta softwear engineer has it to code, debugg softwear, sofwear matintenance, ETC.
 you have to know python, java , java script, CSS, C++, etc
 for most jobs a bacholers is requied for many of the enry level jobs, but you can get a masters of you are looking for something more chalenging
 there are many oppertunitys for growth especily in this day and age of techlology
 i would like to know that basics of computer science and just expoler my oppertunitys that i can have for college so im glad that ther is something i can try and figure out on my own
