there are many types of sensors on the sphero bots, like the acelerometor, pitch, and the light sensors
the one that i want to focus on in the light sensor. 
on the bot there is two diffeent light sensors. 
both on them on opisite sides of the bot.
these sensors respond to light in a way that give the bot instructions, so if one sensor has a light on it and will do a cerian set on instructions, and the reverse is also true about the other sensor. 
the sensors can have seprate stes of intructions so you can have some sort of a game to play with the two sensors.
