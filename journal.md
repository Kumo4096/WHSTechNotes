there are many types of sensors on the sphero bots, like the acelerometor, pitch, and the light sensors
the one that i want to focus on in the light sensor. 
on the bot there is two diffeent light sensors. 
both on them on opisite sides of the bot.
these sensors respond to light in a way that give the bot instructions, so if one sensor has a light on it and will do a cerian set on instructions, and the reverse is also true about the other sensor. 
the sensors can have seprate stes of intructions so you can have some sort of a game to play with the two sensors.

The 4 c's are confident, couragous, consistant, and comunicate
The most inporatnt one i think for the topic of computer science is consistancy. This c means that evertyhing will be basicly the same. and being constitant in the way that you code is deffinently inporatn beacause coding is a very specific endevor so you have to be consistant int he way that you do things. If you even get line thing wrong your code will fail becasue of one little inconsistancy. So being consistant in your coding is probobly the most inportant thing you can do.
